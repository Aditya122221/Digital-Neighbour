          "q": "What are the benefits of PWAs over native apps?",
          "a": "PWAs offer several advantages: no app store approval process, instant updates, smaller size, works across all platforms with one codebase, and can be accessed directly from a browser. They're ideal when you want to reach users quickly without platform-specific development."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can PWAs work offline?",
          "a": "Yes! One of the key features of PWAs is offline functionality. We use service workers to cache content and data, allowing your app to function even without internet connectivity. Users can browse, interact, and perform key actions offline, with data syncing when connectivity returns."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can users install PWAs on their devices?",
          "a": "Absolutely! PWAs can be installed on users' home screens on both mobile and desktop devices. The installation is seamless—users just click an install prompt, and your PWA appears like a native app with its own icon and window."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do PWAs support push notifications?",
          "a": "Yes, PWAs can send push notifications on both desktop and mobile devices, even when the app isn't open. This allows you to re-engage users with updates, reminders, or personalized content, just like native apps."
        },
        {
          "q": "Which browsers support PWAs?",
          "a": "PWAs are supported by all modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (iOS 11.3+), and Samsung Internet. We ensure your PWA works across all major browsers and gracefully degrades on older versions."
